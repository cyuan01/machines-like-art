About

A research project conducted during a summer internship focusing on how
popular machine vision libraries percieve famous pieces of art. With thanks to 
some outstanding Museums, I implemented some scripts to automatically run various
mahcine vision API's to generate tags for each image and displayed them on a website 
to see how machines saw art. 

All work was conducted during an internship and ownership of all materials now 
belongs to Cuseum.
